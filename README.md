# React SVG Map Demo

A playground for SVG keyboard navigation in React. 

Sure, some of these functions could be done differently (or without SVG!). The point of this exercise is to use React APIs to build an interactive component, while maintaining accessibility characteristics for people using assistive technologies.

To set up the project, you will need Node.js and npm or yarn.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```


Run the tests (when there are some):

```bash
npm test
```
